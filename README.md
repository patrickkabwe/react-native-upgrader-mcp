# React Native MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive tools for React Native development experience (DX). This project helps developers streamline React Native workflows including project initialization, version management, upgrades, Expo integration, and other development tasks through automated tools and AI assistance.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Project Initialization**: Create new React Native projects with optimal configurations
-   **Version Management**: Fetch latest stable React Native versions and manage dependencies
-   **Upgrade Automation**: Generate comprehensive upgrade diffs and step-by-step upgrade guidance
-   **Expo Integration**: Streamline Expo React Native app upgrades and configurations
-   **Development Workflows**: Optimize React Native development experience with AI assistance
-   **MCP Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with MCP-compatible AI assistants and development tools

## üéØ Why This Project Was Developed

React Native development involves numerous complex tasks that can be time-consuming and error-prone:

-   **Project Setup**: Initializing new projects with proper configurations and dependencies
-   **Version Management**: Keeping track of stable versions and managing dependency updates
-   **Upgrade Complexity**: Manual analysis of package.json, iOS/Android configurations, and native code changes
-   **Expo Workflows**: Managing Expo SDK upgrades and configuration changes
-   **Development Experience**: Repetitive tasks that slow down development velocity

This MCP server automates these processes and provides AI-assisted guidance, making React Native development more accessible, efficient, and less error-prone. It's designed to work with AI assistants and development tools that support the Model Context Protocol, enhancing the overall developer experience.

## üîß Host Client Setup

This MCP server can be integrated with various AI assistants and development tools that support the Model Context Protocol. Once published to npm, users can install and run it using `npx`.

### Quick Start (After npm Publication)

### Cursor

1. **Install Cursor**: Download and install [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) if you haven't already

2. **Configure MCP Server**:

    **Option A: Using npm package (recommended for users)**

    - Open Cursor
    - Go to Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
    - Search for "MCP" or "Model Context Protocol"
    - Click "Add MCP Server"
    - Configure with:
        ```json
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "react-native-mcp": {
                    "command": "node",
                    "args": ["y", "react-native-mcp"]
                }
            }
        }
        ```

3. **Restart Cursor**: Restart the application to ensure the MCP server is loaded

**Note**: Replace `/path/to/your/rn-app-upgrader` with the actual absolute path to your project directory.

### GitHub Copilot

1. **Install GitHub Copilot**: Ensure you have [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) activated in your IDE

2. **Setup MCP Integration** (if supported):
    - Note: GitHub Copilot's MCP support may vary by IDE
    - For VS Code: Install the "GitHub Copilot" extension
    - Configure MCP servers through the extension settings

### VS Code with Extensions

1. **Install MCP Extension**: Install an MCP-compatible extension like "MCP Server Manager"

2. **Configure Server**:

    **Option A: Using npm package (recommended for users)**

    ```json
    {
        "mcp.servers": {
            "react-native-mcp": {
                "command": "npx",
                "args": ["react-native-mcp"]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### General MCP Configuration

For any MCP-compatible client, you'll typically need:

**Option A: Using npm package (recommended for users)**

```json
{
    "name": "react-native-mcp",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["react-native-mcp"]
}
```
