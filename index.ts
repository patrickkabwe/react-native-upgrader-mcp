This version represents the most recent production-ready release that has been thoroughly tested

The version number follows semantic versioning (e.g. 0.72.0) and excludes any release candidates

This tool is commonly used before planning an upgrade to ensure targeting the latest stable release and must be called before calling get-react-native-diff tool.

    description: `Gets the React Native diff between the current version and the user provided version. This diff will show all changes needed to upgrade React Native, including:
- Package.json dependencies and their versions
- iOS configuration changes (Podfile, xcodeproj settings)
- Android configuration (build.gradle, settings.gradle)
- Project structure changes
- Binary files that need to be updated
- Template files modifications
- Native code changes
- Troubleshooting steps if any

If no fromVersion is provided, the current version from package.json will be used.
The diff follows standard git diff format and should be carefully analyzed to:
1. Update all dependencies to compatible versions
2. Apply configuration changes while preserving custom settings and user defined code
3. Handle binary file updates appropriately
4. Maintain existing customizations in native code and ts/js files
5. Update build tools versions (Gradle, CocoaPods, etc) with the correct version from the diff using specific cmds
6. Preserve any local modifications to template files
7. Please add the end of the process give instruction on the troubleshooting steps if any(Please detect user's package manager and run the correct cmd):
    - DELETE Pod and Podfile.lock file in iOS folder
    - Run pod install to prevent errors in iOS folder
    - Run this cmd to update android binary ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version {{CURRENT_GRADLE_VERSION_FROM_DIFF}} â€”distribution-type {{DISTRIBUTION_TYPE_FROM_DIFF}} in android folder
    - Run {{CURRENT_PACKAGE_MANAGER}} install to install the correct version of the dependencies

YOU MUST call get-react-native-stable-version tool to get the stable version of React Native before calling this tool.
